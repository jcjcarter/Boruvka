Under the Boruvka java file, in the function Main there I initialize an array of threads
that carry out the computations in the given sequence version. To avoid data races between
the threads, I try-lock the Component declared in the while condition. If the try-lock
fails then a continued is called. For the variable Component call "other" I place a try-lock on it
and if the try-lock fails then I unlock the variable Component declared in the while condition.
